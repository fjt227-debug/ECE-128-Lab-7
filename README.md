# ECE-128-Lab-7
The objective of this lab was to design and simulate multiple digital logic systems using Verilog. Specifically, both Moore and Mealy state machines were designed to give an output for 4-bit sequences, 1100 and 1101 respectively. Next, an up-counter was designed to be able to count up to 4095. This was followed by designing a 12-bit binary to 16-bit BCD converter via utilizing the Double Dabble algorithm. Finally, the up-counter and binary to BCD converter were utilized with a clock divider and seven segment display to program the FPGA board to count up to 4095. All designs were simulated using a testbench and the final top module was analyzed based on its area utilization results. 1) Copy files to Vivado project 2) Run sysnthesis and implementation 3)Generate bitstream 4) Program the FPGA board 5)Run the program
